v0.0.1
### Goal:

C++ program that simulates and visualizes behavior of populations of entities simulated from the real world predator/pray systems.

### Requirements:

- Shall be able to simulate predator and pray populations
  - each entity has energy
  - predators get energy from eating pray
  - pray gets energy from eating static food 
  - visualize system
  - simulate system
- Number of entities shall be able to grown up to 10,000 without any noticeable performance issues, FPS shall not be below 30fps
  - implement collision detection mechanism such as Quad Tree
- The information about entities population shall be saved in SVN format
- All code shall be performance and memory monitored and the monitoring shall be visualized visualized
- Test the code, mostly on the functional level
