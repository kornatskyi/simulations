# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) 
## Project: Predator-Prey Simulation and Visualization

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for a C++ program that simulates and visualizes the behavior of predator and prey populations in a simulated ecosystem inspired by real-world predator-prey systems.

#### 1.2 Scope
The program will provide a graphical simulation of predator and prey interactions, allowing users to observe population dynamics and energy transfers within the ecosystem. The simulation will support a large number of entities while maintaining acceptable performance.

### 2. Functional Requirements
#### 2.1 Simulation
- The program shall simulate the behavior of predator and prey populations.
- Each entity shall have an energy attribute that determines its survival and reproduction.
- Predators shall gain energy by consuming prey entities.
- Prey shall gain energy by consuming static food sources in the environment.

#### 2.2 Visualization
- The program shall provide a real-time visualization of the simulated ecosystem.
- The visualization shall display the movement and interactions of predator and prey entities.
- The visualization shall update at a minimum frame rate of 30 frames per second (FPS).

#### 2.3 Performance
- The program shall support a population size of up to 10,000 entities without noticeable performance degradation.
- The program shall maintain a minimum frame rate of 30 FPS during simulation and visualization.

#### 2.4 Collision Detection
- The program shall implement an efficient collision detection mechanism, such as a Quad Tree, to optimize entity interactions.

#### 2.5 Data Persistence
- The program shall save information about the entity populations in a structured format, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values).
- The saved data shall include relevant attributes of the entities, such as position, energy level, and species type.

#### 2.6 Performance Monitoring
- The program shall incorporate performance and memory monitoring mechanisms to track resource usage during runtime.
- The performance and memory usage data shall be visualized in real-time alongside the simulation.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements
#### 3.1 Performance
- The program shall be optimized for efficient memory usage and CPU utilization to ensure smooth performance with large entity populations.

#### 3.2 Usability
- The program shall provide a user-friendly interface for starting, pausing, and resetting the simulation.
- The visualization shall be clear and intuitive, allowing users to easily understand the behavior and interactions of the entities.

#### 3.3 Reliability
- The program shall handle unexpected scenarios gracefully, such as invalid user inputs or resource limitations, without crashing or producing erroneous results.

#### 3.4 Maintainability
- The codebase shall follow best practices and coding standards to ensure readability, modularity, and ease of maintenance.
- The code shall be well-documented with clear comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each component.

### 4. Testing Requirements
#### 4.1 Functional Testing
- The program shall undergo thorough functional testing to verify the correctness of the simulation logic and visualization.
- Test cases shall cover various scenarios, including different population sizes, entity behaviors, and edge cases.

#### 4.2 Performance Testing
- The program shall be tested under different performance conditions to ensure it meets the specified performance requirements.
- Performance tests shall measure frame rates, resource utilization, and scalability with increasing entity populations.

### 5. Constraints
- The program shall be developed using the C++ programming language.
- The program shall not use any external libraries besides C++ standard libraries and SFML graphic library
